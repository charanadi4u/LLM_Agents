      "\n",
      "The Yankees drew first blood in the top of the 1st inning, courtesy of a single by shortstop Anthony Volpe and a two-run homer from center fielder Trent Grisham, putting the visitors up 2-0. However, the Orioles responded swiftly, with Gunnar Henderson's solo shot in the bottom of the 1st reducing the deficit to 2-1.\n",
      "\n",
      "The seesaw battle continued in the top of the 2nd, as Ben Rice's solo homer restored the Yankees' two-run cushion, only for the Orioles to bridge the gap once more. Singles from Anthony Santander and Jorge Mateo set the stage for Cedric Mullins' RBI single, bringing the score to 3-2 in favor of the Yankees.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite opportunities, neither team was able to string together a meaningful rally in the middle innings. The Orioles took the lead for good in the bottom of the 6th inning. Anthony Santander launched a solo homer, and a series of walks and a misplayed grounder allowed two more runs to cross the plate, putting Baltimore up 6-3.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Yankees mounted a spirited comeback in the top of the 9th. Back-to-back singles from Volpe and Grisham loaded the bases, and Ben Rice delivered a sacrifice fly to score a run. But DJ LeMahieu struck out swinging to end the game, securing a thrilling victory for the Orioles.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Performances:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Trent Grisham (NYY):** 3-for-4, 1 home run, 2 RBI, 2 runs\n",
      "* **Ben Rice (NYY):** 2-for-5, 1 home run, 3 RBI\n",

      "**Pitching Breakdown:**\n",

      "The game featured strong performances from both bullpens. Michael Tonkin (NYY) and Jacob Webb (BAL) were particularly effective, each pitching without allowing a run. However, Clay Holmes (NYY) struggled in the 8th inning, allowing three earned runs, which proved to be the difference in the game. Craig Kimbrel (BAL) earned the win despite giving up runs in the 9th, striking out a batter to close out the game.\n",
      "\n",
      "This back-and-forth battle showcased the competitive spirit of both teams and left fans on the edge of their seats until the final out. The Orioles' 6-5 triumph marked a hard-won victory, one that demonstrated their grit and determination.\n"

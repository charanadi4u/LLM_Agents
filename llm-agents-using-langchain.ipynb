      "The power of the presidency has grown substantially since the first president, George Washington, took office in 1789. While presidential power has ebbed and flowed over time, the presidency has played an increasingly significant role in American political life since the beginning of the 20th century, carrying over into the 21st century with notable expansions during the presidencies of Franklin D. Roosevelt and George W. Bush. In modern times, the president is one of the world's most powerful political figures and the leader of the world's only remaining superpower. As the leader of the nation with the largest economy by nominal GDP, the president possesses significant domestic and international hard and soft power. For much of the 20th century, especially during the Cold War, the U.S. president was often called \"the leader of the free world\".\n",
      "Article II of the Constitution establishes the executive branch of the federal government and vests executive power in the president. The power includes the execution and enforcement of federal law and the responsibility to appoint federal executive, diplomatic, regulatory, and judicial officers.  Based on constitutional provisions empowering the president to appoint and receive ambassadors and conclude treaties with foreign powers, and on subsequent laws enacted by Congress, the modern presidency has primary responsibility for conducting U.S. foreign policy. The role includes responsibility for directing the world's most expensive military, which has the second-largest nuclear arsenal.\n",
      "The president also plays a leading role in federal legislation and domestic policymaking. As part of the system of separation of powers, Article I, Section 7 of the Constitution gives the president the power to sign or veto federal legislation. Since modern presidents are typically viewed as leaders of their political parties, major policymaking is significantly shaped by the outcome of presidential elections, with presidents taking an active role in promoting their policy priorities to members of Congress who are often electorally dependent on the president. In recent decades, presidents have also made increasing use of executive orders, agency regulations, and judicial appointments to shape domestic policy.\n",
      "The president is elected indirectly through the Electoral College to a four-year term, along with the vice president. Under the Twenty-second Amendment, ratified in 1951, no person who has been elected to two presidential terms may be elected to a third. In addition, nine vice presidents have become president by virtue of a president's intra-term death or resignation. In all, 45 individuals have served 46 presidencies spanning 58 four-year terms.

A member of the Democratic Party, he previously served as the 47th vice president from 2009 to 2017 under President Barack Obama and represented Delaware in the United States Senate from 1973 to 2009.\n",
      "Born in Scranton, Pennsylvania, Biden moved with his family to Delaware in 1953. He graduated from the University of Delaware before earning his law degree from Syracuse University. He was elected to the New Castle County Council in 1970 and to the U.S. Senate in 1972. As a senator, Biden drafted and led the effort to pass the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act and the Violence Against Women Act. He also oversaw six U.S. Supreme Court confirmation hearings, including the contentious hearings for Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas. Biden ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1988 and 2008. In 2008, Obama chose Biden as his running mate, and he was a close counselor to Obama during his two terms as vice president. In the 2020 presidential election, Biden and his running mate, Kamala Harris, defeated incumbents Donald Trump and Mike Pence. He is the oldest president in U.S. history, and the first to have a female vice president.\n",
      "As president, Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent recession. He signed bipartisan bills on infrastructure and manufacturing. He proposed the Build Back Better Act, which failed in Congress, but aspects of which were incorporated into the Inflation Reduction Act that he signed into law in 2022. Biden appointed Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court. He worked with congressional Republicans to resolve the 2023 United States debt-ceiling crisis by negotiating a deal to raise the debt ceiling. In foreign policy, Biden restored America's membership in the Paris Agreement. He oversaw the complete withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan that ended the war in Afghanistan, during which the Afghan government collapsed and the Taliban seized control. He responded to the Russian invasion of Ukraine by imposing sanctions on Russia and authorizing civilian and military aid to Ukraine. During the Israel–Hamas war, Biden announced military support for Israel, condemned the actions of Hamas and other Palestinian militants as terrorism, and ordered the U.S. military to build a port to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid to Palestinian civilians in Gaza. In April 2023, Biden announced his candidacy for the Democratic nomination in the 2024 presidential election.\n",

      "The power of the presidency has grown substantially since the first president, George Washington, took office in 1789. While presidential power has ebbed and flowed over time, the presidency has played an increasingly significant role in American political life since the beginning of the 20th century, carrying over into the 21st century with notable expansions during the presidencies of Franklin D. Roosevelt and George W. Bush. In modern times, the president is one of the world's most powerful political figures and the leader of the world's only remaining superpower. As the leader of the nation with the largest economy by nominal GDP, the president possesses significant domestic and international hard and soft power. For much of the 20th century, especially during the Cold War, the U.S. president was often called \"the leader of the free world\".\n",

The power includes the execution and enforcement of federal law and the responsibility to appoint federal executive, diplomatic, regulatory, and judicial officers.

The role includes responsibility for directing the world's most expensive military, which has the second-largest nuclear arsenal.\n",
      "The president also plays a leading role in federal legislation and domestic policymaking. As part of the system of separation of powers, Article I, Section 7 of the Constitution gives the president the power to sign or veto federal legislation. Since modern presidents are typically viewed as leaders of their political parties, major policymaking is significantly shaped by the outcome of presidential elections, with presidents taking an active role in promoting their policy priorities to members of Congress who are often electorally dependent on the president. In recent decades, presidents have also made increasing use of executive orders, agency regulations, and judicial appointments to shape domestic policy.\n",

Biden appointed Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court.

In foreign policy, Biden restored America's membership in the Paris Agreement. He oversaw the complete withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan that ended the war in Afghanistan, during which the Afghan government collapsed and the Taliban seized control. He responded to the Russian invasion of Ukraine by imposing sanctions on Russia and authorizing civilian and military aid to Ukraine. During the Israel–Hamas war, Biden announced military support for Israel, condemned the actions of Hamas and other Palestinian militants as terrorism, and ordered the U.S. military to build a port to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid to Palestinian civilians in Gaza.

The president directs the executive branch of the federal government and is the commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces.\\nThe power of the presidency has grown substantially since the first president, George Washington, took office in 1789. While presidential power has ebbed and flowed over time, the presidency has played an increasingly significant role in American political life since the beginning of the 20th century, carrying over into the 21st century with notable expansions during the presidencies of Franklin D. Roosevelt and George W. Bush. In modern times, the president is one of the world\\'s most powerful political figures and the leader of the world\\'s only remaining superpower. As the leader of the nation with the largest economy by nominal GDP, the president possesses significant domestic and international hard and soft power. For much of the 20th century, especially during the Cold War, the U.S. president was often called \"the leader of the free world\".\\nArticle II of the Constitution establishes the executive branch of the federal government and vests executive power in the president. The power includes the execution and enforcement of federal law and the responsibility to appoint federal executive, diplomatic, regulatory, and judicial officers.  Based on constitutional provisions empowering the president to appoint and receive ambassadors and conclude treaties with foreign powers, and on subsequent laws enacted by Congress, the modern presidency has primary responsibility for conducting U.S. foreign policy. The role includes responsibility for directing the world\\'s most expensive military, which has the second-largest nuclear arsenal.\\nThe president also plays a leading role in federal legislation and domestic policymaking. As part of the system of separation of powers, Article I, Section 7 of the Constitution gives the president the power to sign or veto federal legislation. Since modern presidents are typically viewed as leaders of their political parties, major policymaking is significantly shaped by the outcome of presidential elections, with presidents taking an active role in promoting their policy priorities to members of Congress who are often electorally dependent on the president. In recent decades, presidents have also made increasing use of executive orders, agency regulations, and judicial appointments to shape domestic policy.\\nThe president is elected indirectly through the Electoral College to a four-year term, along with the vice president. Under the Twenty-second Amendment, ratified in 1951, no person who has been elected to two presidential terms may be elected to a third. In addition, nine vice presidents have become president by virtue of a president\\'s intra-term death or resignation. In all, 45 individuals have served 46 presidencies spanning 58 four-year terms. Joe Biden is the 46th and current president of the United States, having assumed office on January 20, 2021.\\n\\nPage: List of presidents of the United States\\nSummary: The president of the United States is the head of state and head of government of the United States, indirectly elected to a four-year term via the Electoral College.

Since the office was established in 1789, 45 men have served in 46 presidencies. The first president, George Washington, won a unanimous vote of the Electoral College.

A member of the Democratic Party, he previously served as the 47th vice president from 2009 to 2017 under President Barack Obama and represented Delaware in the United States Senate from 1973 to 2009.\\nBorn in Scranton, Pennsylvania, Biden moved with his family to Delaware in 1953. He graduated from the University of Delaware before earning his law degree from Syracuse University. He was elected to the New Castle County Council in 1970 and to the U.S. Senate in 1972. As a senator, Biden drafted and led the effort to pass the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act and the Violence Against Women Act. He also oversaw six U.S. Supreme Court confirmation hearings, including the contentious hearings for Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas. Biden ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1988 and 2008. In 2008, Obama chose Biden as his running mate, and he was a close counselor to Obama during his two terms as vice president. In the 2020 presidential election, Biden and his running mate, Kamala Harris, defeated incumbents Donald Trump and Mike Pence. He is the oldest president in U.S. history, and the first to have a female vice president.\\nAs president, Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent recession. He signed bipartisan bills on infrastructure and manufacturing. He proposed the Build Back Better Act, which failed in Congress, but aspects of which were incorporated into the Inflation Reduction Act that he signed into law in 2022. Biden appointed Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court. He worked with congressional Republicans to resolve the 2023 United States debt-ceiling crisis by negotiating a deal to raise the debt ceiling. In foreign policy, Biden restored America's membership in the Paris Agreement. He oversaw the complete withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan that ended the war in Afghanistan, during which the Afghan government collapsed and the Taliban seized control. He responded to the Russian invasion of Ukraine by imposing sanctions on Russia and authorizing civilian and military aid to Ukraine. During the Israel–Hamas war, Biden announced military support for Israel, condemned the actions of Hamas and other Palestinian militants as terrorism, and ordered the U.S. military to build a port to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid to Palestinian civilians in Gaza. In April 2023, Biden announced his candidacy for the Democratic nomination in the 2024 presidential election.\\n\\nPage: Family of Joe Biden\\nSummary: Joe Biden, the 46th and current president of the United States, has family members who are prominent in law, education, activism and politics. Biden's immediate family became the first family of the United States on his inauguration on January 20, 2021. His immediate family circle was also the second family of the United States from 2009 to 2017, when Biden was vice president. Biden's family is mostly descended from the British Isles, with most of their ancestors coming from Ireland and England, and a smaller number descending from the French.\\nOf Joe Biden's sixteen great-great-grandparents, ten were born in Ireland. He is descended from the Blewitts of County Mayo and the Finnegans of County Louth. One of Biden's great-great-great-grandfathers was born in Sussex, England, and emigrated to Maryland in the United States by 1820.\\n\\nPage: Presidency of Joe Biden\\nSummary: Joe Biden's tenure as the 46th president of the United States began with his inauguration on January 20, 2021. Biden, a Democrat from Delaware who previously served as vice president for two terms under President Barack Obama, took office following his victory in the 2020 presidential election over Republican incumbent president Donald Trump.

Harding, and Franklin D. Roosevelt), four were assassinated (Abraham Lincoln, James A. Garfield, William McKinley, and John F.

John Tyler was the first vice president to assume the presidency during a presidential term, and set the precedent that a vice president who does so becomes the fully functioning president with his own administration.\\nThroughout most of its history, American politics has been dominated by political parties. The Constitution is silent on the issue of political parties, and at the time it came into force in 1789, no organized parties existed.

Concerned about the capacity of political parties to destroy the fragile unity holding the nation together, Washington remained unaffiliated with any political faction or party throughout his eight-year presidency. He was, and remains, the only U.S. president never affiliated with a political party.\\nThe incumbent president is Joe Biden, who assumed office on January 20, 2021.'"

With it have come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biolo-gy, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the devel-opment of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining,machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings butare often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas inthese areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, theemphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberaluse of color graphics. It should be a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interestedin data mining in science or industry. The book’s coverage is broad, from supervised learning(prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, supportvector machines, classification trees and boosting—the first comprehensive treatment of thistopic in any book.\\nThis major new edition features many topics not covered in the original, including graphical\\nmodels, random forests, ensemble methods, least angle regression & path algorithms for thelasso, non-negative matrix factorization, and spectral clustering. There is also a chapter onmethods for “wide” data (p bigger than n), including multiple testing and false discovery rates.\\nTrevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman are professors of statistics at\\nStanford University. They are prominent researchers in this area: Hastie and Tibshiranideveloped generalized additive models and wrote a popular book of that title. Hastie co-developed much of the statistical modeling software and environment in R/S-PLUS andinvented principal curves and surfaces. Tibshirani proposed the lasso and is co-author of thevery successful An Introduction to the Bootstrap.

As a result,\\nwe hope that this book will appeal not just to statisticians b ut also to\\nresearchers and practitioners in a wide variety of ﬁelds.\\nJust as we have learned a great deal from researchers outside of the ﬁeld\\nof statistics, our statistical viewpoint may help others to better understand\\ndiﬀerent aspects of learning:\\nThere is no true interpretation of anything; interpretatio n is a\\nvehicle in the service of human comprehension.

It is similar to K-means in that it assigns observations to clusters based on their likelihood of belonging to each cluster. However, Gaussian mixture models are often referred to as a soft clustering method because they allow observations to belong to multiple clusters with varying degrees of membership, while K-means is a hard clustering method because it assigns observations to a single cluster. Gaussian mixture models can be used to represent the feature density in each class, which produces smooth posterior probabilities for classifying a given data point. They can also be used for density estimation and can be viewed as a kind of kernel method. The parameters of a Gaussian mixture model are typically fit using maximum likelihood and the EM algorithm.'"

      "Summary: In machine learning, support vector machines (SVMs, also support vector networks) are supervised max-margin models with associated learning algorithms that analyze data for classification and regression analysis. Developed at AT&T Bell Laboratories by Vladimir Vapnik with colleagues (Boser et al., 1992, Guyon et al., 1993, Cortes and Vapnik, 1995, Vapnik et al., 1997) SVMs are one of the most studied models, being based on statistical learning frameworks of VC theory proposed by Vapnik (1982, 1995) and Chervonenkis (1974). \n",
      "In addition to performing linear classification, SVMs can efficiently perform a non-linear classification using what is called the kernel trick, implicitly mapping their inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces. Being max-margin models, SVMs are resilient to noisy data (for example, mis-classified examples). SVMs can also be used for regression tasks, where the objective becomes \n",

      "The support vector clustering algorithm, created by Hava Siegelmann and Vladimir Vapnik, applies the statistics of support vectors, developed in the support vector machines algorithm, to categorize unlabeled data. These data sets require unsupervised learning approaches, which attempt to find natural clustering of the data to groups and, then, to map new data according to these clusters. \n",
      "The popularity of SVMs is likely due to their amenability to theoretical analysis, their flexibility in being applied to a wide variety of tasks, including structured prediction problems. It is not clear that SVMs have better predictive performance than other linear models, such as logistic regression and linear regression.\n",

SVMs can also be used for regression tasks, where the objective becomes \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        ϵ\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle \\\\epsilon }\\n  \\n-sensitive.\\nThe support vector clustering algorithm, created by Hava Siegelmann and Vladimir Vapnik, applies the statistics of support vectors, developed in the support vector machines algorithm, to categorize unlabeled data. These data sets require unsupervised learning approaches, which attempt to find natural clustering of the data to groups and, then, to map new data according to these clusters. \\nThe popularity of SVMs is likely due to their amenability to theoretical analysis, their flexibility in being applied to a wide variety of tasks, including structured prediction problems. It is not clear that SVMs have better predictive performance than other linear models, such as logistic regression and linear regression.\\n\\nPage: Relevance vector machine\\nSummary: In mathematics, a Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) is a machine learning technique that uses Bayesian inference to obtain parsimonious solutions for regression and probabilistic classification.\\nThe RVM has an identical functional form to the support vector machine, but provides probabilistic classification.\\nIt is actually equivalent to a Gaussian process model with covariance function:\\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        k\\n        (\\n        \\n          x\\n        \\n        ,\\n        \\n          \\n            x\\n            ′\\n          \\n        \\n        )\\n        =\\n        \\n          ∑\\n          \\n            j\\n            =\\n            1\\n          \\n          \\n            N\\n          \\n        \\n        \\n          \\n            1\\n            \\n              α\\n              \\n                j\\n              \\n            \\n          \\n        \\n        φ\\n        (\\n        \\n          x\\n        \\n        ,\\n        \\n          \\n            x\\n          \\n          \\n            j\\n          \\n        \\n        )\\n        φ\\n        (\\n        \\n          \\n            x\\n          \\n          ′\\n        \\n        ,\\n        \\n          \\n            x\\n          \\n          \\n            j\\n          \\n        \\n        )\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle k(\\\\mathbf {x} ,\\\\mathbf {x'} )=\\\\sum _{j=1}^{N}{\\\\frac {1}{\\\\alpha _{j}}}\\\\varphi (\\\\mathbf {x} ,\\\\mathbf {x} _{j})\\\\varphi (\\\\mathbf {x} ',\\\\mathbf {x} _{j})}\\n  \\n\\nwhere \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        φ\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle \\\\varphi }\\n  \\n is the kernel function (usually Gaussian), \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          α\\n          \\n            j\\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle \\\\alpha _{j}}\\n  \\n are the variances of the prior on the weight vector\\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        w\\n        ∼\\n        N\\n        (\\n        0\\n        ,\\n        \\n          α\\n          \\n            −\\n            1\\n          \\n        \\n        I\\n        )\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle w\\\\sim N(0,\\\\alpha ^{-1}I)}\\n  \\n, and \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          \\n            x\\n          \\n          \\n            1\\n          \\n        \\n        ,\\n        …\\n        ,\\n        \\n          \\n            x\\n          \\n          \\n            N\\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle \\\\mathbf {x} _{1},\\\\ldots ,\\\\mathbf {x} _\")]}"
